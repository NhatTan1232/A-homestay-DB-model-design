## Given Task
- "Imagine you are tasked with designing a database for a system like AirBNB . You will be working on your own and have a limited timeline."
- "You can use Lucidchart, ERDPlus, dbdiagram.io or Draw.io to design your model."


## Technologies Used
- Lucidchart for model designing
- SQL Server Management Studio 19 for SQL statements


## Files Included
- An Entity-Relationship Diagram
- A  Logical Data Model
- A Physical Data Model
- A document explaining your design
- A SQL file containing SQL statements for creating the model


## How I Made It
### First, I listed a few main features that Airbnb provides
- List active rooms
- Post room information on the website
- Filter information on rooms (categories, room types)
- Message the host
- Log in, manage users
- Reviews, ratings
- Manage room bookings
- Manage room amenities
- Multiple payment options
- Revenue and sales statistics

### Second, I designed the model
Based on the features above, I created the entities
- User and Place
- Master data for Place's location and amenities
- Bank and Coupon
- Booking orders
- Then connect them all together where relevant

### Finally, I made the SQL statements 
Created the tables based on the physical data model and added in some constraints where needed

## Improvements
I'm open for more improvement on this, feel free to comment if you have any.
Thank you!
